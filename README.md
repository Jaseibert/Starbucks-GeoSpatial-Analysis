This is a fun exploratory analysis of the Starbucks Store Directory, and at the end I build a tool that uses folium to plot the Starbucks in a User-defined City or Country. 

## Project Overview:

1. The Starbucks Store Directory
2. Now let's explore the completeness of the directory
3. How many Null values are in the Directory?
4. What is the Country "International Market" Saturation of Starbucks?
5. What cities across the world hold the most Starbucks?
6. Starbucks Seoul!
7. Who owns that Starbucks? - Ownership Types
8. Where are these Stores?

## Project Packages:

`pandas`
`matplotlib.pyplot`
`numpy`
`folium`

## Analysis Type
